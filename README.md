# System Verilog Functional Coverage
I have successfully completed the “Introduction to SystemVerilog Functional Coverage Language” course on Udemy. Throughout this course, I gained a strong understanding of how functional coverage complements code coverage in the verification process by ensuring all design scenarios are thoroughly tested. I learned how to write and implement covergroups, coverpoints, and cross coverage in SystemVerilog to measure verification completeness effectively. The course also enhanced my ability to identify missing corner cases, improve testbench quality, and apply functional coverage concepts in real-world verification projects. By the end of the training, I developed the skills to integrate functional coverage into a modern verification methodology, enabling more efficient and robust validation of digital designs. This course has strengthened my foundation in SystemVerilog verification .
